# Analogue-Analog-Clock-Display-using-a-GC9A01-display-attached-to-an-ESP32-plus-sound
This project builds on an earlier project 'Analogue (Analog) Clock Display using a GC9A01 display attached to an ESP32' but adds the sounds of chimes and strikes as per a large clock such as Big Ben.
An ESP32 using its WiFi capabilities acquires NTP time, transmits this time to an Arduino with a DFPlayer to make sounds, and then displays an analogue clock on the GA9A01 display unit.
Rather than repeat the details of the earlier project, please refer to that project for basic information about displaying an analogue clock face. The information is the additional instructions for adding sound.
